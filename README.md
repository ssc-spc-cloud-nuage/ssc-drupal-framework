# SSC Drupal Framework

A framework for common modules, styles and functionality shared between SSC projects.

It's currently being used for:

## Updating the framework dependency in a project's Composer file

To update the framework version in a project, run the following command from the project's root directory in your terminal, replacing `X.X.X` with the actual version that you need:

```
composer require ssc-spc-cloud-nuage/ssc-drupal-framework:"X.X.X"
```
